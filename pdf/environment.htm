	      <p>
	      Between 1970 and 2005, 320,000 acres of open space were lost to development, or 25 acres each and every day for 35 years. The continued disappearance of our open space has resulted in significant negative consequences for our environment and quality of life. Our open spaces naturally help to improve our air and water quality, contribute to our region's character, and even return economic value to our region. Further, they serve as sources for fresh, local, and nutritious foods and provide opportunities for recreation, relaxation, and exploration.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      Just over one million acres of open space and unprotected land remain in our region. While this may seem like a sizable sum to many, these lands and their considerable environmental, agricultural, and recreational benefits are endangered by sprawling development patterns and require significant efforts for protection and conservation. Preserving more than 500,000 acres is an important step in ensuring that our region has the resources it will need to sustain itself in the future. We can achieve this goal through a combination of efforts including smart growth development, open space acquisitions, conservation easements, the purchase of development rights, environmental protection ordinances, and, at the most basic level, the promotion of good stewardship. We must ensure that our most treasured open spaces aren't lost forever.

		  <!--{{{-->
		  <div class="accorditem">
		    <h4>To preserve 500,000 acres of open space we must:</h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Focus future development as infill and redevelopment in existing areas, and target new development to designated future growth areas.</li>
		      <li>Encourage compact, centers-based development through Smart Growth tools and techniques, such as transit-oriented development, traditional neighborhood design, transfer of development rights, and revitalization and stabilization of existing development to strengthen local communities and reduce suburban sprawl.</li>
		      <li>Employ a range of regulatory and voluntary funding techniques to preserve open space, including fee-simple acquisitions, conservation easements, locally-funded open space programs, statewide preservation trusts, municipal natural resource protection plans and ordinances, and market-based conservation such as development rights transfer programs.</li>
		      <li>
Champion opportunities to integrate greening initiatives at local and regional levels including community gardens, shade trees, green streets, green roofs, and green schoolyards.

		    <p><h4><a href="/asp/connections/2035landuse.htm" target="_blank">2035 Land Use Plan Map</a></h4>
		    The Land Use Plan map defines a regional vision for growth management and open space preservation. <em>Connections</em> proposes concentrating most new growth in the form of infill and redevelopment into the region's Existing Developed Areas.  The Land Use Plan map also identifies Future Growth Areas - areas that have infrastructure in place or planned and are appropriate for future development
		    </p>

		    <p><h4><a href="/connections/pdf/2035_Greenspace_Network.pdf" target="_blank">Greenspace Network</a><span class='sm'> [0.8 MB pdf]</span></h4>
		    The <em>Connections</em> plan proposes linking and expanding the region's existing protected natural areas into a Greenspace Network, where parks, forests, meadows, stream corridors, and floodplains are joined together in an inter-connected system.  The Greenspace Network will protect core natural resource areas and will enhance recreational opportunities.
		    </p>

		    <p><h4><a href="/connections/pdf/2035_Conservation_Focus_areas.pdf" target="_blank">Conservation Focus Areas</a><span class='sm'> [0.8 MB pdf]</span></h4>
Conservation Focus Areas depict large agricultural, natural, and rural areas worthy of heightened preservation efforts.  The Conservation Focus Areas contain villages and scattered suburban development, but they remain mostly unfragmented and can be maintained through strategic acquisitions and easements, land management, and appropriate forms of growth.  These are not "no-growth zones", but instead are areas whose natural, agricultural, and recreational value should be protected, while allowing for limited growth that is in character with each region.

		    DVPRC and its partners are actively pursuing a number of projects that will help us achieve our goal of preserving 500,000 acres of open space.

<h3>DVRPC Initiatives</h3>
<h4>Municipal Environmental Services</h4>
Achieving the vision of the <em>Connections</em> Plan Greenspace Network and Conservation Focus Areas relies in large part on municipal actions to identify and protect their resources.  Recognizing this connection, DVRPC conducts municipal open space and natural resource planning services for New Jersey communities.  To date, over 50 projects including Environmental Resource Inventories, Open Space and Recreation Plans, Farmland Preservation Plans, Conservation Elements of the Master Plan and Conservation Design Ordinances are underway or have been completed. 
</p>

<p><h4><a href="/Environment/OpenSpace/" target="_blank">Green Space Connection to the Economy</a></h4>
For open space needs to be heard in the midst of the current economic downturn, the green space issue must  be explicitly connected to economic development and vitality.  DVRPC is partnering with the Greenspace Alliance of Southeastern Pennsylvania on conducting a study that will quantify the economic value of the PA counties' protected open spaces.  The results of the study are due in the summer of 2010 and will be used to reframe the dialogue about open space as a benefit, not just an expense, and to raise support for more open space preservation.
</p>

<h3>Local Examples</h3>
<p><h4>Peacedale Preserve</h4>
A 113-acre property in Franklin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania was recently purchased by the Natural Lands Trust protecting it from future development. Natural Lands Trust will combine the parcel with an adjacent property it already owns to establish the 173-acre Peacedale Preserve that will include approximately 1.5 miles of trails for public use.
</p>
<p><h4>Turtle Creek Preserve</h4>
Protection of the Mullica River estuary has been bolstered by the preservation of a 259-acre property in Washington Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. The property - Turtle Creek Preserve - was transferred to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation for wetland and wildlife habitat migration. It will be open to the public for hiking and nature observation

		    <p>
		    The City of Philadelphia's 10,000 acres of parkland provide an annual payback of $1.26 billion in health and direct use benefits, cost savings, and revenue to the City and its residents <acronym title="How Much Value Does the City of Philadelphia Receive From its Park and Recreation System?, A Report by The Trust for Public Land for the Philadelphia Parks Alliance, June 2008.">[ * ]</acronym>. Similar benefits would be expected in communities across the region.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    <h4>Additionally, effective growth management and open space preservation will:</h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>
Improve water and air quality, enhance personal health, and contribute to our region's character.
		      </li>
		      <li>
Enhance our quality of life by providing opportunities for recreation, relaxation, and exploration. 
		      </li>
		      <li>
		      Save money by limiting the need for ever-expanding drinking water, wastewater, and transportation infrastructure that is becoming increasingly difficult to finance, build, and maintain.
		      </li>
		      <li>
		      Preserve farmland and strengthen the local agricultural industry to improve access to healthier, fresher, and tastier foods.
		      </li>
		      <li>
Protect scenic, historic, and cultural sites and landscapes that attract visitors and revenue into our region.
		      </li>
		    </ul>
